My submission for Game Off 2021 - Glitchshot

Glitchshot is a first-person shooter game in which the player is able to control glitches, like rubberbanding or clipping through walls, and use them to their advantage. Each level, the player must destroy all the targets hidden around the area to unlock the door to the next level. Gameplay rewards the player for being careful and deliberate with their actions, since there are only a limited amount of bullets given to the player and there is no time limit for any of the levels.

Glitchshot was fully developed by myself in a 1-week time limit, using Unity and C#. Although Game Off 2021 allows contestants up to a month to design their game, I only worked on it for 1 week during Thanksgiving break. The UI and models are very basic, since I prioritized trying to create a new idea and turn it into a playable game in a short time. No external resources or assets were used, except for the thumbnail for the game's itch.io page.
