My submission for Game Off 2021 - Glitchshot

Glitchshot is a first-person shooter game in which the player is able to control glitches, like rubberbanding or clipping through walls, and use them to their advantage. Each level, the player must destroy all the targets hidden around the area to unlock the door to the next level. Gameplay rewards the player for being careful and deliberate with their actions, since there are only a limited amount of bullets given to the player and there is no time limit for any of the levels.
